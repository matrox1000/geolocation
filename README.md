Code for paper "Identifying places using multimodal social  network data"
Social media is an interesting source of information, specially
when physical sensors are not available. In this paper, we explore several
methodologies for the geolocation of multimodal information (image and
text) from social networks. To this end, we use pre-trained neural network

models for the classification of images and their associated texts. The re-
sult is a system that allows creating new synergies between image and

text in order to geolocate information that has not been previously geo-
tagged by any other way, which is a potentially relevant information for

several purposes. Different experiments have been done revealing that,
in general, text information is more accurate and relevant than images.
